    <h2>
      <i>THE COLONIAL MORTUARY BARD</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A writer in the <i>Sydney Evening News</i> last year gave that journal
      some amusing extracts from the visitors&rsquo; book at Longwood, St. Helena. If
      the extracts are authentic copies of the original entries, they deserve to
      be placed on the same high plane as the following, which appeared in a
      Melbourne newspaper some years ago:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Our Emily was so fair
     That the angels envied her,
     And whispered in her ear,
     &lsquo;We will take you away on Tuesday night!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I once considered this to be the noblest bit of mortuary verse ever
      written; but since reading the article in the Sydney paper I have changed
      my opinion, and now think it poor. Bonaparte, however, was a great
      subject, and even the most unintelligent mortuary verse-maker could not
      fail to achieve distinction when the Longwood visitors&rsquo; book was given up
      unto him. Frenchmen, especially, figure largely. Here, for instance:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Malidiction. O grand homme!
     O grand Napoleon!
     Mais la France et toi aont venge&mdash;
     Hudson Lowe est mort!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The last line is so truly heroic&mdash;French heroic. It instantly
      recalled to me a tale told by an English journalist who, on a cycling tour
      in France just after the Fashoda crisis, left his &ldquo;bike&rdquo; under the care of
      the proprietor of an hotel in Normandy. In the morning he found the tyres
      slashed to pieces, and on the saddle a gummed envelope, on which was
      bravely written, &ldquo;Fashoda.&rdquo; This was unintentional mortuary poetry. The
      gallant Frenchman who did the daring deed when the owner of the &ldquo;bike&rdquo; was
      asleep did not realise that the word itself was a splendid mortuary epic
      for French aspirations generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes something vigorous from one &ldquo;Jack Lee-Cork,&rdquo; who writes:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The tomb of Napoleon we visit to-day,
     And trod on the spot where the tyrant lay;
     That his equal again may never appear,
     &lsquo;Twill be sincerely prayed for many a year.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The masters and officers of some of the whale-ships touching at St. Helena
      seem to have made pilgrimages to Longwood. Mr. William Miller, master of
      the barque <i>Hope</i>, of New Bedford, writes that he &ldquo;visited the
      remains of the greatest warrior of the day, interred for twenty years.&rdquo;
       Then he breaks out into these noble lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Here lies the warrior, bravest of the brave,
     Visited by Miller, God the Queen may save.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As a Britisher I shake your hand, William. When you wrote that, forty
      years ago, American whaling or any other kind of skippers did not
      particularly care about our nation; but you, William, were a white man.
      How easily you might have said something nasty about us and made &ldquo;brave&rdquo;
       rhyme with &ldquo;grave&rdquo;! But you were a real poet, and above hurting our
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Miller was evidently accompanied by some of his crew, one of whom
      contributes this gem of prose:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis F. Waldron, on bord the barke hope of nubedford, its boat steer,
      has this day been to see honey&rsquo;s tomb; we are out 24 munts, with 13
      hundred barils of sperm oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All greasy luck attend you, honest Louis, boatsteerer, in the shades
      beyond. You wielded harpoon and lance better than the pen, and couldn&rsquo;t
      write poetry. Your informing statement about the &ldquo;ile&rdquo; at once recalled to
      memory an inscription upon the wooden head-board of the grave of another
      boat-steerer which in 1873 was to be seen at Ponapê, in the Caroline
      Islands:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;Sacred to Memory of Jno.
           Hollis of sagharbour
      boatsterer of ship Europa of new
           Bedford who by will of
   almity god died of four ribs stove in by a
      off pleasant island north pacific
                 4.17.69.&rdquo;
 
</pre>
    <p>
      Sailors love the full-blooded, exhaustive mortuary poem as well as any
      one, and generally like to describe in detail the particular complaint or
      accident from which a shipmate died. Miners, too, like it. Many years ago,
      in a small mining camp on the Kirk River, in North Queensland, I saw the
      following inscription painted on the head-board of the grave of a miner
      who had fallen down a shaft:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Remember, men, when you pass by,
     What you are now, so once was I.
     Straight down the Ripper No. 3 shaft I fell;
     The Lord preserve my soul from hell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      On the Palmer River diggings (also in North Queensland) one William Baker
      testified to his principles of temperance in the following, written on the
      back of his &ldquo;miner&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; which was nailed to a strip of deal from a
      packing-case:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Bill Baker is my name,
     A man of no faim,
     But I was I of the First
     In this great Land of thirst
     To warn a good mate
     Of the sad, dreadful fate,
     That will come to him from drink.
     &mdash;Wm. Baker of S. Shields, England.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But let me give some more quotations from the Longwood visitors&rsquo; book.
      Three midshipmen of the <i>Melville</i> irreverent young dogs, write:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We three have endeavoured, by sundry potations of Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      brandy, to arrive at a proper pitch of enthusiasm always felt, or assumed
      to be, by pilgrims to this tomb. It has, however, been a complete failure,
      which I fear our horses will rue when we arrive at the end of our
      pilgrimage.&mdash;Three Mids. of the <i>Melville</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is another gross insult to France&mdash;an insult which, fortunately
      for England, has escaped the notice of the French press. And now two more
      extracts from the delicious article in the Sydney paper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Collins, master of the <i>Hawk</i> of Glasgow, from Icaboe, bound
      to Cork for orders. In hope never to have anything to do with the dung
      trade! And God send us all a good passage home to old England. Amen! At
      Longwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sympathise with <i>you</i>, good William! You describe the
      guano-carrying industry by a somewhat rude expression; but as a seafaring
      man who has had the misfortune to be engaged in the transportation of the
      distressful but highly useful product, I shake your hand even as I shake
      the greasy hand of Mr. William Miller, the New Bedford blubber-hunter. My
      benison on you both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last excerpt in the book is&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;One murder makes a villain, millions a hero;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and underneath a brave Frenchman writes&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;You lie&mdash;you God-dam Englishman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;REO,&rdquo; THE FISHERMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reo was a short, squat Malayan, with a face like a skate, barring his
      eyes, which were long, narrow slits, apparently expressing nothing but
      supreme indifference to the world in general. But they would light up
      sometimes with a merry twinkle when the old rogue would narrate some of
      his past villainies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to Samoa in the old, old days&mdash;long before Treaties, and
      Imperial Commissioners, and other gilded vanities were dreamt of by us
      poor, hard-working traders. He seemed to have dropped from the sky when
      one afternoon, as Tom Denison, the supercargo, and some of his friends sat
      on Charley the Russian&rsquo;s verandah, drinking lager, he marched up to them,
      sat down on the steps, and said, &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; said Schlüter, the skipper of the <i>Anna Godeffrey</i>. &ldquo;Who <i>are</i>
      you? Where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reo waved a short, stumpy and black clay pipe to and fro, and replied
      vaguely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one laughed, surmising correctly enough that he had run away from a
      ship; then they remembered that no vessel had even touched at Apia for a
      month. (Later on he told Denison that he had jumped overboard from a
      Baker&rsquo;s Island guano-man, as she was running down the coast, and swum
      ashore, landing at a point twenty miles distant from Apia. The natives in
      the various villages had given him food, so when he reached the town he
      was not hungry.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, anyway?&rdquo; asked Schlüter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some tobacco, please. And a dollar or two. I can pay you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Hamilton the pilot incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pipe described a semicircle. &ldquo;Oh, to-morrow night&mdash;before,
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They gave him some tobacco and matches, and four Bolivian &ldquo;iron&rdquo;
       half-dollars. He got up and went across to Volkner&rsquo;s combined store and
      grog shanty, over the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to buy a bottle of square-face,&rdquo; said Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; said Denison gloomily. &ldquo;A man of his age who could jump
      overboard and swim ashore to this rotten country should be presented with
      a case of gin&mdash;and a knife to cut his throat with after he has
      finished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In about ten minutes the old fellow came out of Volkner&rsquo;s store, carrying
      two or three stout fishing-lines, several packets of hooks, and half a
      dozen ship biscuits. He grinned as he passed the group on the verandah,
      and then squatting down on the sward near by began to uncoil the lines and
      bend on the hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Denison was interested, went over to him, and watched the swift, skilful
      manner in which the thin brown fingers worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to fish?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad, flat face lit up. &ldquo;Outside in the dam deep water&mdash;sixty,
      eighty fa&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denison left him and went aboard the ancient, cockroach-infested craft of
      which he was the heartbroken supercargo. Half an hour later &lsquo;Reo paddled
      past the schooner in a wretched old canoe, whose outrigger was so
      insecurely fastened that it threatened to come adrift every instant. The
      old man grinned as he recognised Denison; then, pipe in mouth, he went
      boldly out through the passage between the lines of roaring surf into the
      tumbling blue beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock, just as the supercargo and the skipper were taking their
      last nip before turning in, the ancient slipped quietly alongside in his
      canoe, and clambered on deck. In his right hand he carried a big
      salmon-like fish, weighing about 20 lbs. Laying it down on the deck, he
      pointed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty more in canoe like that. You want some more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Denison went to the side and looked over. The canoe was loaded down to the
      gunwale with the weight of fish&mdash;fish that the lazy, loafing Apian
      natives caught but rarely. The old man passed up two or three more, took a
      glass of grog, and paddled ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he repaid the borrowed money and showed Denison fifteen
      dollars&mdash;the result of his first night&rsquo;s work in Samoa. The
      saloon-keepers and other white people said he was a treasure. Fish in Apia
      were dear, and hard to get.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the following Sunday a marriage procession entered the Rarotongan
      chapel in Matafele, and Tetarreo (otherwise *Reo) was united to one of the
      prettiest and not <i>very</i> disreputable native girls in the town, whose
      parents recognised that &lsquo;Reo was likely to prove an eminently lucrative
      and squeezable son-in-law. Denison was best man, and gave the bride a
      five-dollar American gold piece (having previously made a private
      arrangement with the bridegroom that he was to receive value for it in
      fish).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reo&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s relatives built the newly-married couple a house on Matautu
      Point, and &lsquo;Reo spent thirty-five dollars in giving the bride&rsquo;s local
      connections a feast. Then the news spread, and cousins and second cousins
      and various breeds of aunts and half-uncles travelled up to Matautu Point
      to partake of his hospitality. He did his best, but in a day or so
      remarked sadly that he could not catch fish fast enough in a poor canoe.
      If he had a boat he could make fifty dollars a week, he said; and with
      fifty dollars a week he could entertain his wife&rsquo;s honoured friends
      continuously and in a befitting manner. The relatives consulted, and,
      thinking they had &ldquo;a good thing,&rdquo; subscribed, and bought a boat (on
      credit) from the German firm, giving a mortgage on a piece of land as
      security. Then they presented &lsquo;Reo with the boat, with many complimentary
      speeches, and sat down to chuckle at the way they would &ldquo;make the old fool
      work,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;old fool&rdquo; went straight away to the American Consul and
      declared himself to be a citizen of the United States and demanded his
      country&rsquo;s protection, as he feared his wife&rsquo;s relatives wanted to jew him
      out of the boat they had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Consul wrote out something terrifying on a big sheet of paper, and
      tacked it on to the boat, and warned the surprised relatives that an
      American man-of-war would protect &lsquo;Reo with her guns, and then &lsquo;Reo went
      inside his house and beat his wife with a canoe paddle, and chased her
      violently out of the place, and threatened her male relatives with a large
      knife and fearful language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took the boat round the other side of the island and sold it for
      two hundred dollars to a trader, and came back to Apia to Denison and
      asked for a passage to Tutuila, and the German firm entered into and took
      possession of the mortgaged land, whilst the infuriated relatives tore up
      and down the beach demanding &lsquo;Reo&rsquo;s blood in a loud voice. &lsquo;Reo, with his
      two hundred dollars in his trousers&rsquo; pocket, sat on the schooner&rsquo;s rail
      and looked at them stolidly and without ill-feeling.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Denison landed the ancient at Leone Bay on Tutuila, for he had taken
      kindly to the old scoundrel, who had many virtues, and could give points
      to any one, white or brown, in the noble art of deep-sea fishing. This
      latter qualification endeared him greatly to young Tom, who, when he was
      not employed in keeping the captain sober, or bringing him round after an
      attack of &ldquo;D.T.&lsquo;s,&rdquo; spent all his spare time in fishing, either at sea or
      in port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reo settled at Leone, and made a good deal of money buying copra from the
      natives. The natives got to like him&mdash;he was such a conscientious old
      fellow. When he hung the baskets of copra on the iron hook of the
      steelyard, which was marked to weigh up to 150 lbs., he would call their
      attention to the marks as he moved the heavy &ldquo;pea&rdquo; along the yard. Then,
      one day, some interfering Tongan visitor examined the pea and declared
      that it had been taken from a steelyard designed to weigh up to 400 lbs.
      &lsquo;Reo was so hurt at the insinuation that he immediately took the whole
      apparatus out beyond the reef in his boat and indignantly sunk it in fifty
      fathoms of water. Then he returned to his house, and he and his wife (he
      had married again) bade a sorrowful farewell to his friends, and said his
      heart was broken by the slanders of a vile Tongan pig from a mission
      school. He would, he said, go back to Apia, where he was respected by all
      who knew him. Then he began to pack up. Some of the natives sided with the
      Tongan, some with &lsquo;Reo, and in a few minutes a free fight took place on
      the village green, and &lsquo;Reo stood in his doorway and watched it from his
      narrow, pig-like eyes; then, being of a magnanimous nature, he walked over
      and asked three stout youths, who had beaten the Tongan into a state of
      unconsciousness, and were jumping on his body, not to hurt him too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight &lsquo;Reo&rsquo;s house was seen to be in flames, and the owner,
      uttering wild, weird screams of &ldquo;<i>Fia ola! Fia ola!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mercy!
      Mercy!&rdquo;) fled down the beach to his boat, followed by his wife, a large,
      fat woman, named appropriately enough Taumafa (Abundance). They dashed
      into the water, clambered into the boat, and began pulling seaward for
      their lives. The villagers, thinking they had both gone mad, gazed at them
      in astonishment, and then went back and helped themselves to the few goods
      saved from the burning house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as &lsquo;Reo and the good wife were out of sight of the village they
      put about, ran the boat into a little bay further down the coast, planted
      a bag containing seven hundred dollars, with the best of the trade goods
      (salved <i>before</i> the fire was discovered), and then set sail for Apia
      to &ldquo;get justice from the Consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Consul said it was a shocking outrage, the captain of U.S.S.
      Adirondack concurred, and so the cruiser, with the injured, stolid-faced
      &lsquo;Reo on board, steamed off to Leone Bay and gave the astounded natives
      twelve hours to make up their minds as to which they would do&mdash;pay
      &lsquo;Reo one thousand dollars in cash or have their town burnt. They paid six
      hundred, all they could raise, and then, in a dazed sort of way, sat down
      to meditate as they saw the <i>Adirondack</i> steam off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reo gave his wife a small share of the plunder and sent her home to her
      parents. When Tom Denison next saw him he was keeping a boarding house at
      Levuka, in Fiji. He told Denison he was welcome to free board and lodging
      for a year. &lsquo;Reo had his good points, as I have said.

    <h2>
      THE BLACK BREAM OF AUSTRALIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next to the lordly and brilliant-hued schnapper, the big black bream of
      the deep harbour waters of the east coast of Australia is the finest fish
      of the bream species that have ever been caught. Thirty years ago, in the
      hundreds of bays which indent the shores of Sydney harbour, and along the
      Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers, they were very plentiful and of great
      size; now, one over 3 lbs. is seldom caught, for the greedy and dirty
      Italian and Greek fishermen who infest the harbour with their fine-meshed
      nets have practically exterminated them. In other harbours of New South
      Wales, however&mdash;notably Jervis and Twofold Bays&mdash;these handsome
      fish are still plentiful, and there I have caught them winter and summer,
      during the day under a hot and blazing sun, and on dark, calm nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In shape the black bream is exactly as his brighter-hued brother, but his
      scales are of a dark colour, like partially tarnished silver; he is
      broader and heavier about the head and shoulders, and he swims in a more
      leisurely, though equally cautious, manner, always bringing-to the instant
      anything unusual attracts his attention. Then, with gently undulating tail
      and steady eye, he regards the object before him, or watches a shadow
      above with the keenest scrutiny. If it is a small, dead fish, or other
      food which is sinking, say ten yards in front, he will gradually come up
      closer and closer, till he satisfies himself that there is no line
      attached&mdash;then he makes a lightning-like dart, and vanishes in an
      instant with the morsel between his strong, thick jaws. If, however, he
      sees the most tempting bait&mdash;a young yellow-tail, a piece of white
      and red octopus tentacle, or a small, silvery mullet&mdash;and detects
      even a fine silk line attached to the cleverly hidden hook, he makes a
      stern-board for a foot or two, still eyeing the descending bait; then,
      with languid contempt, he slowly turns away, and swims off elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my boyhood&rsquo;s days black-bream fishing was a never-ending source of
      delight to my brothers and myself. We lived at Mosman&rsquo;s Bay, one of the
      deepest and most picturesque of the many beautiful inlets of Sydney
      Harbour. The place is now a populous marine suburb with terraces of
      shoddy, jerry-built atrocities crowding closely around many beautiful
      houses with spacious grounds surrounded by handsome trees. Threepenny
      steamers, packed with people, run every half-hour from Sydney, and the
      once beautiful dell at the head of the bay, into which a crystal stream of
      water ran, is as squalid and detestable as a Twickenham lane in summer,
      when the path is strewn with bits of greasy newspaper which have held
      fried fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the days of which I speak, Mosman&rsquo;s Bay was truly a lovely spot,
      dear to the soul of the true fisherman. Our house&mdash;a great
      quadrangular, one-storied stone building, with a courtyard in the centre&mdash;was
      the only one within a radius of three miles. It had been built by convict
      hands for a wealthy man, and had cost, with its grounds and magnificent
      carriage drives, vineyards, and gardens, many thousand pounds. Then the
      owner died, bankrupt, and for years it remained untenanted, the
      recrudescent bush slowly enveloping its once highly cultivated lands, and
      the deadly black snake, iguana, and &lsquo;possum harbouring among the deserted
      outbuildings. But to us boys (when our father rented the place, and the
      family settled down in it for a two years&rsquo; sojourn) the lonely house was a
      palace of beautiful imagination&mdash;and solid, delightful fact, when we
      began to explore the surrounding bush, the deep, clear, undisturbed waters
      of the bay, and a shallow lagoon, dry at low water, at its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across this lagoon, at the end near the deep water, a causeway of stone
      had been built fifty-five years before (in 1820) as a means of
      communication by road with Sydney. In the centre an opening had been left,
      about twenty feet wide, and across this a wooden bridge had been erected.
      It had decayed and vanished long, long years before we first saw the
      place; but the trunk of a great ironbark tree now served equally as well,
      and here, seated upon it as the tide began to flow in and inundate the
      quarter-mile of dry sand beyond, we would watch the swarms of fish passing
      in with the sweeping current.
    </p>
    <p>
      First with the tide would come perhaps a school ot small blue and silver
      gar-fish, their scarlet-tipped upper mandibles showing clear of the water;
      then a thick, compact battalion of short, dumpy grey mullet, eager to get
      up to the head of the lagoon to the fresh water which all of their kind
      love; then communities of half a dozen of grey and black-striped &ldquo;black
      fish&rdquo; would dart through to feed upon the green weed which grew on the
      inner side of the stone causeway. Then a hideous, evil-eyed &ldquo;stingaree,&rdquo;
       with slowly-waving outspread flappers, and long, whip-like tail, follows,
      intent upon the cockles and soft-shell clams which he can so easily
      discover in the sand when he throws it upwards and outwards by the
      fan-like action of his thin, leathery sides. Again more mullet&mdash;big
      fellows these&mdash;with yellow, prehensile mouths, which protrude and
      withdraw as they swim, and are fitted with a straining apparatus of
      bristles, like those on the mandibles of a musk duck. They feed only on
      minute organisms, and will not look at a bait, except it be the tiny worm
      which lives in the long celluroid tubes of the coral growing upon <i>congewei</i>.
      And then you must have a line as fine as horsehair, and a hook small
      enough&mdash;but strong enough to hold a three-pound fish&mdash;to tempt
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the tide rose higher, and the incoming water bubbled and hissed as it
      poured through the narrow entrance underneath the tree-bole on which we
      sat, red bream, silvery bream, and countless myriads of the small,
      staring-eyed and delicate fish, locally known as &ldquo;hardy-heads,&rdquo; would rush
      in, to return to the deeper waters of the bay as the tide began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes&mdash;and perhaps &ldquo;Red Spinner&rdquo; of the <i>Field</i> may have
      seen the same thing in his piscatorial wanderings in the Antipodes&mdash;huge
      gar-fish of three or four feet in length, with needle-toothed, narrow
      jaws, and with bright, silvery, sinuous bodies, as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm,
      would swim languidly in, seeking for the young mullet and gar-fish which
      had preceded them into the shallow waters beyond. These could be caught by
      the hand by suddenly gripping them just abaft of the head. A Moruya River
      black boy, named &ldquo;Cass&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, Casanova), who had been brought up
      with white people almost from infancy, was a past-master in this sort of
      work. Lying lengthwise upon the tree which bridged the opening, he would
      watch the giant gars passing in, swimming on the surface. Then his right
      arm would dart down, and in an instant a quivering, twisting, and gleaming
      &ldquo;Long Tom&rdquo; (as we called them) would be held aloft for a moment and then
      thrown into a flour-sack held open in readiness to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely this was &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in the full sense of the word; for although &ldquo;Long
      Tom&rdquo; is as greedy as a pike, and can be very easily caught by a floating
      bait when he is hungry, it is not every one who can whip him out of the
      water in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were at least four varieties of mullet which frequented the bay, and
      in the summer we frequently caught numbers of all four in the lagoon by
      running a net across the narrow opening, and when the tide ran out we
      could discern their shining bodies hiding under the black-leaved sea-grass
      which grew in some depressions and was covered, even at low tide, by a few
      inches of water. Two of the four I have described; and now single
      specimens of the third dart in&mdash;slenderly-bodied, handsome fish about
      a foot long. They are one of the few varieties of mullet which will take a
      hook, and rare sport they give, as the moment they feel the line they leap
      to and fro on the surface, in a series of jumps and somersaults, and very
      often succeed in escaping, as their jaws are very soft and thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it is slack water there is a depth of six feet covering the
      sandy bottom of the lagoon, the rush and bubble under the tree-bole has
      ceased, and every stone, weed, and shell is revealed. Now is the time to
      look on the deep-water side of the causeway for the big black bream.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they are&mdash;thirty, fifty&mdash;perhaps a hundred of them,
      swimming gently to and fro outside the entrance, longing, yet afraid to
      enter. As you stand up, and your shadow falls upon their line of vision,
      they &ldquo;go about&rdquo; and turn head on to watch, sometimes remaining in the same
      position, with gently moving fins and tails, for five minutes; sometimes
      sinking down to the blue depths beyond, their outlines looming grey and
      indistinct as they descend, to reappear again in a few minutes, almost on
      the surface, waiting for the dead mullet or gar-fish which you may perhaps
      throw to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old ex-Tasmanian convict who was employed to attend to the boat in
      which we boys went across to Sydney three days a week, weather permitting,
      to attend school, had told us that we &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t hook e&rsquo;er a one o&rsquo; thim
      black bream; the divils is that cunning, masters, that you can&rsquo;t do it. So
      don&rsquo;t thry it. &lsquo;Tis on&rsquo;y a-waistin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But we knew better; we were born in the colony&mdash;in a seaport town on
      the northern coast&mdash;and the aborigines of the Hastings River tribe
      had taught us many valuable secrets, one of which was how to catch black
      bream in the broad light of day as the tide flowed over a long stretch of
      sand, bare at low water, at the mouth of a certain &ldquo;blind&rdquo; creek a few
      miles above the noisy, surf-swept bar. But here, in Mosman&rsquo;s Bay, in
      Sydney, we had not the cunningly devised gear of our black friends&mdash;the
      principal article of which was the large uni-valve <i>aliotis</i> shell&mdash;to
      help us, so we set to work and devised a plan of our own, which answered
      splendidly, and gave us glorious sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tide was out and the sands were dry, carrying a basket containing
      half a dozen strong lines with short-shanked, thick hooks, and two or
      three dozen young gar-fish, mullet, or tentacles of the octopus, we would
      set to work. Baiting each hook so carefully that no part of it was left
      uncovered, we dug a hole in the sand, in which it was then partly buried;
      then we scooped out with our hands a narrow trench about six inches deep
      and thirty or forty yards in length, into which the line was laid, covered
      up roughly, and the end taken to the shore. After we had accomplished
      laying our lines, radiating right and left, in this manner we covered each
      tempting bait with an ordinary crockery flower-pot, weighted on the top
      with a stone to keep it in its place, and then a thin tripping-line was
      passed through the round hole, and secured to a wooden cross-piece
      underneath. These tripping-lines were then brought ashore, and our
      preparations were complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; one may ask, &ldquo;all this elaborate detail, this burying of lines,
      and, most absurd of all, the covering up of the baited hook with a
      flowerpot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simply this. As the tide flows in over the sand there come with it, first
      of all, myriads of small garfish, mullet, and lively red bream, who, if
      the bait were left exposed, would at once gather round and begin to nibble
      and tug at it. Then perhaps a swiftly swimming &ldquo;Long Tom,&rdquo; hungry and
      defiant, may dart upon it with his terrible teethed jaws, or the great
      goggle-eyed, floundering sting-ray, as he flaps along his way, might suck
      it into his toothless but bony and greedy mouth; and then hundreds and
      hundreds of small silvery bream would bite, tug, and drag out, and finally
      reveal the line attached, and then the scheme has come to naught, for once
      the cute and lordly black bream sees a line he is off, with a contemptuous
      eye and a lazy, proud sweep of tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tide was near the full flood we would take the ends of our
      fishing- and tripping-lines in our hands and seat ourselves upon the high
      sandstone boulders which fringed the sides of the bay, and from whence we
      could command a clear view of the water below. Then, slowly and carefully,
      we tripped the flower-pots covering the baits, and hauled them in over the
      smooth sandy bottom, and, with the baited lines gripped tight in the four
      fingers of our right hands, we watched and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, in such calm, transparent water, we could, to our added
      delight, see the big bream come swimming along, moving haughtily through
      the crowds of small fry&mdash;yellow-tail, ground mullet, and trumpeters.
      Presently, as one of them caught sight of a small shining silvery mullet
      (or a luscious-looking octopus tentacle) lying on the sand, the languid
      grace of his course would cease, the broad, many-masted dorsal fin become
      erect, and he would come to a dead stop, his bright, eager eye bent on the
      prize before him. Was it a delusion and a snare? No! How could it be? No
      treacherous line was there&mdash;only the beautiful shimmering scales of a
      delicious silvery-sided young mullet, lying dead, with a thin coating of
      current-drifted sand upon it. He darts forward, and in another instant the
      hook is struck deep into the tough grizzle of his white throat; the line
      is as taut as a steel wire, and he is straining every ounce of his
      fighting six or eight pounds&rsquo; weight to head seawards into deep water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and steadily with him, else his many brothers will take alarm, and
      the rest of the carefully laid baits will be left to become the prey of
      small &ldquo;flatheads,&rdquo; or greedy, blue-legged spidery crabs. Once his head is
      turned, providing he is well hooked, he is safe, and although it may take
      you ten minutes ere you haul him into such shallow water that he cannot
      swim upright, and he falls over upon his broad, noble side, and slides out
      upon the sand, it is a ten minutes of joy unalloyed to the youthful
      fisherman who takes no heed of two other lines as taut as his own, and
      only prays softly to himself that his may be the biggest fish of the
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, we managed to get a fish upon every one of the ten or twelve
      lines we set in this manner, and as we always used short, stout-shanked
      hooks of the best make, we rarely lost one. On one occasion, however, a
      ten-foot sawfish seized one of our baits, and then another and another,
      and in five minutes the brute had entangled himself amongst the rest of
      the lines so thoroughly that our old convict boatman, who was watching us
      from his hut, yelled out, as he saw the creature&rsquo;s serrated snout raised
      high out of the water as it lashed its long, sinuous tail to and fro, to
      &ldquo;play him&rdquo; till he &ldquo;druv an iron into it.&rdquo; He thought it was a whale of
      some sort, and, jumping into a dinghy, he pulled out towards it, just in
      time to see our stout lines part one after another, and the &ldquo;sawfish&rdquo; sail
      off none the worse for a few miserable hooks in his jaws and a hundred
      fathoms of stout fishing lines encircling his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      This old Bill Duggan&mdash;he had &ldquo;done&rdquo; twenty-one years in that abode of
      horror, Port Arthur in Tasmania, for a variegated assortment of crimes&mdash;always
      took a deep interest in our black-bream fishing, and freely gave us a
      shilling for each one we gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told us that by taking them to Sydney he could sell them for two
      shillings each, and that he would send the money to a lone, widowed sister
      who lived in Bridgnorth, England. Our mother deeply sympathised with the
      aged William (our father said he was a lying old ruffian), and always let
      him take the boat and pull over to Sydney to sell the fish. He generally
      came back drunk after twenty-four hours&rsquo; absence, and said the sun had
      affected him. But Nemesis came at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day some of the officers of H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i>, with some Sydney
      friends, came to spend a Saturday and Sunday with us. It rained hard on
      the Saturday night, and the stream which fell into the head of the bay
      became a roaring torrent, sending a broad line of yellow, muddy foam
      through the narrow opening of the causeway, which I have before mentioned,
      into the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly disappointed that we could not give our guests the sport which we
      had promised them, we sat upon the causeway and gazed blankly upon the
      yellowed waters of the bay with bitterness in our hearts. Suddenly &ldquo;Cass,&rdquo;
       the Moruya River black boy, who was standing beside us, turned to us with
      a smile illumining his sooty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for you coola (angry)? Now the time to catch big pfeller brack
      bream. Water plenty pfeller muddy. Brack bream baal (is not) afraid of
      line now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I, being the youngest, was sent off, with furious brotherly threats and
      yells, to our guests, to tell them to come down at once with their fishing
      tackle. I tore up the path and reached the house. The first-lieutenant,
      commodore&rsquo;s secretary, and two ladies at once rose to the occasion, seized
      their beautiful rods (at which my brothers and myself were undecided
      whether to laugh in contempt or to profoundly admire) and followed me down
      to the causeway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we reached there Billy Duggan and my brothers had already landed
      half a dozen splendid fish, one of which, of over ten pounds, was held up
      to us for inspection as a curiosity, inasmuch as a deep semicircular piece
      had been bitten out of its back (just above the tail) by a shark or some
      other predatory fish. The wound had healed over perfectly, although its
      inner edge was within a quarter of an inch of the backbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a brief glance at the fish already taken, the two officers and the
      ladies had their rods ready, and made a cast into the surging, yellow
      waters, with disastrous results, for in less than three minutes every one
      of them had hooked a fish&mdash;and lost it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no fishing for finnickin&rsquo; graylin&rsquo;, or such like pretty-pretties av
      of the ould counthry,&rdquo; said the old convict patronisingly, as his
      toothless mouth expanded into a grin. &ldquo;These blue-nosed devils would break
      the heart and soul av the best greenheart as was iver grown. Lay down thim
      sthicks an&rsquo; take wan of these,&rdquo; and he pointed to some thick lines, ready
      coiled and baited with pieces of raw beef. &ldquo;Just have thim out into the
      wather, and hould on like grim death&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Sure the boys here
      have taught me a mighty lot I niver larned before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our visitors &ldquo;hived&rdquo; out the already baited lines, and caught a dozen or
      more of splendid fish, varying from 6 lbs. to 10 lbs. in weight, and then,
      as a drenching downpour of rain blotted out everything around us, we went
      home, leaving our take with Billy, with the exception of two or three of
      the largest, which we brought home with us for supper. He whispered to my
      brothers and myself that he would give us &ldquo;ten bob&rdquo; for the lot; and as
      the old villain&rsquo;s money was extremely useful to us, and our parents knew
      nothing about our dealings with the ancient reprobate, we cheerfully
      agreed to the &ldquo;ten bob&rdquo; suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I have said, Nemesis was near to William Duggan, Esq., over this
      matter of the black bream, for on the following Tuesday Lieut. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;happened
      across the leading fishmonger&rsquo;s shop in Hunter Street, where there were
      displayed several splendid black bream. One of these, he noticed, had a
      large piece bitten out of the back, and he at once recognised it. He
      stepped inside and asked the black-moustached Grecian gentleman who
      attended to the counter the price of the fish, and where they were caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine shillings each, sir. They are a very scarce fish, and we get them
      only from one man, an old fellow who makes his living by catching them in
      Mosman&rsquo;s Bay. We give him five shillings each for every fish over 6 lbs.,
      and seven-and-sixpence for every one over 10 lbs. No one else but this old
      fellow can catch black bream of this size. He knows the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      H&mdash;&mdash;, thinking he was doing us boys a good turn, wrote a line
      to our father, telling him in a humorous manner all about this particular
      wretched back-bitten black bream which he had recognised, and the price he
      had been asked for it. Then my father, having no sense of humour, gave us,
      one and all, a sound thrashing for taking money from old Duggan, who
      thereafter sold our black bream to a hawker man who travelled around in a
      spring cart, and gave him three shillings each, out of which we got two,
      and spent at a ship chandler&rsquo;s in buying fresh tackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For &lsquo;twas not the &ldquo;filthy lucre&rdquo; we wanted, only the sport.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
