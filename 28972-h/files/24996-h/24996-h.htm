    <h2>
      I ~ THE &ldquo;STARLIGHT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      As the rising sun had just begun to pierce the misty tropic haze of early
      dawn, a small, white-painted schooner of ninety or a hundred tons burden
      was bearing down upon the low, densely-wooded island of Mayou, which lies
      between the coast of south-east New Guinea and the murderous Solomon Group&mdash;the
      grave of the white man in Melanesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white population of Mayou was not large, for it consisted only of an
      English missionary and his wife&mdash;who was, of course, a white woman&mdash;a
      German trader named Peter Schwartzkoff and his native wife; an English
      trader named Charlie Blount, with his two half-caste sons and daughters;
      and an American trader and ex-whaler, named Nathaniel Burrowes, with his
      wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the island is of large extent, and of amazing fertility, the
      native population was at this time comparatively small, numbering only
      some three thousand souls. They nearly all lived at the south-west end of
      the island, the rendezvous of the few trading ships that visited the
      place. Occasionally a surveying vessel, and, at longer intervals still, a
      labour-recruiting ship from Hawaii or Fiji, would call. At such times the
      monotony of the lives of the white residents of Mayou was pleasantly
      broken. Once a year, too, a missionary vessel would drop anchor in the
      little reef-bound port, but her visit was of moment only to the Rev. Mr.
      Deighton, his wife, and their native converts, and the mission ship&rsquo;s
      presence in the harbour was taken no notice of by the three white traders;
      for a missionary ship is not always regarded by the average trader in the
      South Seas as a welcome visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost with the rising of the sun the vessel had been sighted from the
      shore by a party of natives, who were fishing off the south end of the
      island, and in a few minutes their loud cries reached other natives on
      shore, and by them was passed on from house to house along the beach till
      it reached the town itself. From there, presently, came a deep sonorous
      shout, &ldquo;<i>Evaka! Evaka!</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;A ship! A ship!&rdquo;), and then they swarmed
      out of their thatched dwellings like bees from a hive and ran, laughing
      and shouting together, down to the beach in front of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clamour increased, the Rev. Wilfrid Deighton opened the door of his
      study and stepped out upon the shady verandah of the mission house, which
      stood upon a gentle, palm-covered rise about five hundred yards from the
      thickly clustering houses of the native village. He was a tall, thin man
      with a scanty brown beard, and his face wore a wearied, anxious
      expression. His long, lean body, coarse, toil-worn hands, and shabby
      clothing indicated, too, that the lines of the Rev. Wilfrid had not been
      cast in a pleasant place when he chose the wild, unhealthy island of Mayou
      as the field of his labours. But if he showed bodily traces of the hard,
      continuous toil he had undergone during the seven years&rsquo; residence among
      the people of Mayou, his eye was still full of the fire of that noble
      missionary spirit which animated the souls of such earnest men as Moffat
      and Livingstone, and Williams of Erromanga, and Gordon of Khartoum. For he
      was an enthusiast, who believed in his work; and so did his wife, a
      pretty, faded little woman of thirty, with a great yearning to save souls,
      though at times she longed to return to the comforts and good dinners of
      semi-civilisation in other island groups nearer the outside world she had
      been away from so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary stepped out on the verandah, and shaded his eyes from the
      glare with his rough, sun-tanned hands, as he looked seaward at the
      advancing vessel. Soon his wife followed him and placed her hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Wilfrid? Surely not the <i>John Hunt</i>. She is not due for
      months yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not her, certainly, Alice,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and not a trading vessel
      either, I should think. She looks more like a yacht Perhaps she may be a
      new man-of-war schooner. However, we will soon see. Put on your hat, my
      dear, and let us go down to the beach. Already Blount, Schwartzkoff, and
      Burrowes have gone; and it certainly would not do for me to remain in the
      background when the newcomers land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Deighton, her pale face flushing with gentle excitement at the
      prospect of meeting Europeans, quickly retired to her room, and making a
      rapid toilette, rejoined her husband, who, white umbrella in hand, awaited
      her at the gate.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the reverend gentleman, a few minutes
      later, as, accompanied by Mrs. Deighton, he joined the three white
      traders, &ldquo;what vessel is it? Have you any idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; answered Blount, with a short nod to Mr. Deighton, but
      lifting his leaf hat to his wife, &ldquo;we were just wondering ourselves.
      Doesn&rsquo;t look like a trader&mdash;more like a gunboat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the schooner had worked her way in through the passage, and,
      surrounded by a fleet of canoes, soon brought up and anchored. Her sails
      were very quickly handled, then almost as soon as she swung to her anchor
      a smart, white-painted boat was lowered, and the people on shore saw the
      crew haul her up to the gangway ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a white man, who, by his dress, was an officer of the ship,
      followed by another person in a light tweed suit and straw hat, entered
      the boat, which then pushed off and was headed for the shore. As she
      approached nearer, the traders and the missionary could see that the crew
      were light-skinned Polynesians, dressed in blue cotton jumpers, white duck
      pants, and straw hats. The officer&mdash;who steered with a steer-oar&mdash;wore
      a brass-bound cap and brass-buttoned jacket, and every now and then turned
      to speak to the man in the tweed suit, who sat smoking a cigar beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jingo! she&rsquo;s a yacht, I believe,&rdquo; said Charlie Blount, who had been
      keenly watching the approaching boat; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off. I don&rsquo;t want to be
      bothered with people of that sort&mdash;glorified London drapers, who ask
      &lsquo;Have you&mdash;ah&mdash;got good shooting heah?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning on his heel, he raised his hat to Mrs. Deighton, nodded to
      the other white men, and sauntered along the beach to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Blount&rsquo;s kinder set again meetin&rsquo; people like these,&rdquo; said
      Burrowes, nodding in the direction of the boat and addressing himself to
      Mr. and Mrs. Deighton. &ldquo;Reckon they might be some all-powerful British
      swells he knew when he was one himself. Guess they won&rsquo;t scare <i>me</i> a
      cent&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Id was brober dadt he should veel so,&rdquo; remarked the German; &ldquo;if some
      Yerman shentle-mans vas to come here und zee me dresd like vom dirty
      sailor mans, den I too vould get me home to mein house und say nodings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton, speaking reproachfully, yet secretly
      pleased at Blount&rsquo;s departure, &ldquo;no man need feel ashamed at meeting his
      countrymen on account of the poverty of his attire; I am sure that the
      sight of an English gentleman is a very welcome one to me and Mrs.
      Deighton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Burrowes with easy but not offensive familiarity, &ldquo;I guess,
      parson, thet you and Mrs. Deighton hed better form yourselves inter a
      committee of welcome, and tell them so; I ain&rsquo;t much in the polite
      speechifying line myself, neither is &lsquo;Schneider&rsquo; here,&rdquo; nodding at the
      German, &ldquo;and you can sling in somethin&rsquo; ornymental &lsquo;bout me bein&rsquo; the
      representative of the United States&mdash;a gentleman a-recrootin&rsquo; of his
      health in the South Sea Islands doorin&rsquo; a perlitercal crisis in
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the boat had run her bows up on to the white, sandy beach,
      and the straw-hatted, tweed-suited gentleman jumped lightly out Taking off
      his hat with a graceful, circular sweep, which included every one on the
      beach, white and native, he said with languid politeness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, gentlemen; I scarcely hoped to have the pleasure of meeting
      Europeans at this place&mdash;and certainly never imagined that pleasure
      would be enhanced by the presence of a lady,&rdquo; he added as he caught sight
      of Mrs. Deighton standing apart some little distance from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to meet you, sir,&rdquo; said the missionary, constituting himself
      spokesman for the others; &ldquo;you are welcome, sir, very welcome to Mayou,
      and to anything that it lies in our power to furnish you with for your&mdash;schooner,
      or should I say yacht, for such, by her handsome appearance, I presume she
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor, who was a handsome, fair-haired man, with a blonde moustache
      and blue eyes, bowed his thanks, and then said, &ldquo;May I have the honour to
      introduce myself. My name is De Vere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am the Rev. Wilfrid Deighton, missionary in charge of this island.
      My two&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (here he hesitated a moment before the next word)
      &ldquo;friends are Mr. Peter Schwartzkoff and Mr. Nathaniel Burrowes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to meet you,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere, bowing politely to the lady,
      but extending a white, shapely hand to the men; &ldquo;and now I must tell you
      that I shall be very glad to avail myself, Mr. Deighton, of your kind
      offer. We are in want of water, and anything in the way of vegetables,
      etcetera, that we can get. We intend, however, to stay here a few days and
      refit. Having been in very bad weather coming through the southern part of
      the Solomon Group we must effect repairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I inquire, mister,&rdquo; asked Burrowes, &ldquo;ef your vessel is a trader, or
      jest a pleasure schooner, as the parson here says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Deighton is quite correct,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere, with another graceful
      bow; &ldquo;the <i>Starlight</i> is a yacht I can quite understand your not
      being able to make her out She was originally built for the navy as a
      gunboat, but was sold in Sydney, after some years&rsquo; service. I bought her
      and had her altered into a yacht to cruise about these delightful and
      beautiful South Sea Islands. My friend, the Honourable John
      Morcombe-Lycett, accompanies me. Our English yachting experience had much
      to do with our determination to make a cruise down here. In fact,&rdquo; and
      here Mr. de Vere showed his white, even teeth in a smile, and stroked his
      drooping blonde moustache, &ldquo;we left London with the intention of
      chartering a vessel in Sydney for a cruise among the islands. Mr.
      Morcombe-Lycett is, however, very unwell to-day, and so has not landed,
      but here am I; and I am very happy indeed to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning towards the boat, he called out to the officer who had
      brought him, &ldquo;Come ashore for me at dinner-time, Captain Sykes.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      II ~ A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few hours later Mr. de Vere was on very friendly terms with Mr. and Mrs.
      Deighton, who had carried him off to the mission house, after the boat
      returned to the schooner. Before he accompanied them, however, he told
      Messrs. Burrowes and Schwartzkoff, as he shook hands, that he would not
      fail to visit them later on in the day at their respective houses. And
      both Peter, and the American, who on any other occasion would have been
      justly indignant at any white visitor not a missionary himself foregoing,
      even for a short time, the pleasure of their society for that of a
      &ldquo;blarsted missionary,&rdquo; shook hands with him most vigorously, and said they
      would be proud to see him. Then they hurried off homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s house and trading station lay midway between that of Charlie
      Blount and the American&rsquo;s, but instead of making for his own place, Peter,
      to the surprise of Blount, who was now standing at his door watching them,
      went inside Burrowes&rsquo; house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s d&mdash;&mdash;d curious, now,&rdquo; said Blount, in English, to one of
      his half-caste daughters, a girl of eighteen; &ldquo;those two fellows hate each
      other like poison. I&rsquo;ve never known the Dutchman go into the Yankee&rsquo;s
      house, or the Yankee go into his, for the past two years, and here they
      are now as thick as thieves! I wonder what infernal roguery they are up
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie Blount&rsquo;s amazement was perfectly natural, The German and American
      did dislike each other most intensely. Neither of them had lived so long
      on Mayou as Blount, but each was trying hard to work the other man off the
      island by accusing him to the natives of cheating them. As a matter of
      fact they were both scoundrels, but Banderah, the chief of Mayou, who was
      fond of white men, managed to keep a hollow peace between them. <i>He</i>
      was perfectly well aware that both of them cheated himself and his people,
      but as long as their cheating was practised moderately he did not mind. In
      Blount, however, he had the fullest confidence, and this good feeling was
      shared with him by every native on the island.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Perhaps, had Blount been a witness of what occurred when the boat landed,
      his suspicion of his fellow-traders&rsquo; honesty would have been considerably
      augmented. For while the missionary and Mr. de Vere were bandying
      compliments, the German and American were exchanging signs with the
      officer who was in charge of the boat, and whom De Vere addressed as
      &ldquo;Captain Sykes.&rdquo; The American, indeed, had started down the beach to speak
      to him, when Mr. de Vere called out to him to return to the ship, and
      Captain Sykes, with a gesture signifying that he would see Burrowes later
      on, swung round the boat&rsquo;s head and gave the word to his Kanaka crew to
      give way. As if quite satisfied with this dumb promise, the American
      returned to the group he had just left, and then the moment the
      missionary, Mrs. Deighton, and De Vere had gone, he and the German started
      off together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment they entered the American&rsquo;s house, Burrowes sat down on the
      table and the German on a gin case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Dutchy,&rdquo; said Burrowes, looking keenly at his companion, &ldquo;I reckon
      you know who the almighty swell in the brass-bound suit is, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yaw,&rdquo; replied Schwartzkoff, &ldquo;it is Bilker, und I thought he was in brison
      for ten years mit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s true enough that he did get ten years. But that&rsquo;s six years
      ago, an&rsquo; I reckon they&rsquo;ve let him out. Public feelin&rsquo; in Australia agin
      nigger catchin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t very strong; an&rsquo; I reckon he&rsquo;s got out after doin&rsquo; 
      five or six years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot is so,&rdquo; asserted the German; and then he leaned forward, &ldquo;but vat vas
      he doing here in dis fine, swell schooner mit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest what you and me is goin&rsquo; to find out, Dutchy. An&rsquo; I guess
      that you an&rsquo; me <i>can</i> find out darned easy. Bilker ain&rsquo;t going to
      fool <i>me</i>; if he&rsquo;s on to anything good, I guess I&rsquo;m going to have a
      cut in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veil, ve see by und by, ven he comes ashore. Von ding, I dells you, mine
      friend. Dot fine shentleman don&rsquo;t know vat you und me knows about Captain
      Bilker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American gave an affirmative wink, and then going to a rude cupboard
      he took out a bottle of gin and a couple of tin mugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look hyar, Peter, I guess you and me&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do some business together
      over this schooner, so let&rsquo;s make friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vas agreeable,&rdquo; said the German with alacrity, rising from his seat and
      accepting the peace-offering. He nodded to Burrowes and tossed it off.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      By lunch-time Mr. Morcombe-Lycett had been brought ashore and had accepted
      Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s invitation to remain for the night He was a well-dressed,
      good-looking man of about thirty-five, and was, so Mr. Deighton
      sympathisingly announced to his wife, suffering from a touch of malarial
      fever, which a little quinine and nursing would soon put right Mr.
      Deighton himself, by the way, was suffering from the same complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, as Charlie Blount was walking past Burrowes&rsquo; house, he was
      surprised to see that the German was still there. He was about to pass on&mdash;for
      although on fairly friendly terms with the two men, he did not care for
      either of them sufficiently well to enter their houses often, although
      they did his&mdash;when the American came to the door and asked him to
      come in and take a nip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to board the schooner?&rdquo; asked Burrowes, as Blount came in
      and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going down to Lak-a-lak. I&rsquo;ve got some natives cutting timber for
      me there, and thought I would just walk along the beach and see how they
      are getting on. Besides that, my little girl Nellie is there with her
      uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Burrowes, with genuine surprise, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you go aboard and see
      if they have any provisions to sell? I heard you say the other day that
      you had quite run out of tinned meats and nearly out of coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have; but I don&rsquo;t care about going on board for all that&rdquo; Then
      looking the two men straight in the face, he drank off the gin, set the
      mug down on the table, and resumed, &ldquo;I saw by my glass that that damned,
      cut-throat blackbirder, Bilker, is her skipper. That&rsquo;s enough for me. I
      heard that the infernal scoundrel got ten years in gaol. Sorry he wasn&rsquo;t
      hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vy,&rdquo; said the German, whose face was considerably flushed by the liquor
      he had been drinking, &ldquo;you vas in der plackpird drade yourselves von
      dime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was, Peter,&rdquo; said Blount quietly, &ldquo;but <i>we</i> did the thing
      honestly, fairly and squarely. I, and those with me, when I was in the
      labour trade, never stole a nigger, nor killed one. This fellow Bilker was
      a disgrace to every white man in the trade. He is a notorious,
      cold-blooded murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation fell a bit flat after this, for Mr. Burrowes and Mr.
      Schwartzkoff began to feel uncomfortable. Six or seven years before,
      although then unknown to each other and living on different islands, they
      each had had business relations with Captain Bilker in the matter of
      supplying him with &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; during his cruises for &ldquo;blackbirds,&rdquo; and each
      of them had so carried on the trade that both were ultimately compelled to
      leave the scene of their operations with great haste, and take up their
      residence elsewhere, particularly as the commander of the cruiser which
      arrested Captain Bilker expressed a strong desire to make their
      acquaintance and let them keep him company to the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; resumed the American, &ldquo;I guess every man hez got his own opinions
      on such things. I hev mine&mdash;&mdash; Why, here&rsquo;s Mr. de Vere. Walk
      right in, sir, an&rsquo; set down; and Mister Deighton, too. Howdy do, parson?
      I&rsquo;m real glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the visitors entered Blount rose to go, but the missionary,
      with good-natured, blundering persistency, pressed him back, holding his
      hand the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. de Vere, this is Mr. Blount, a most excellent man, I do assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Blount, taking the smiling Englishman&rsquo;s hand in his,
      but quickly dropping it. There was something in De Vere&rsquo;s set smile and
      cold, watery-blue eyes that he positively resented, although he knew not
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as the somewhat dull-minded Deighton seemed very anxious for him
      to stay and engage in &ldquo;doing the polite&rdquo; to his guest, Blount resumed his
      seat, but did so with restraint and impatience showing strongly in his
      sun-burnt, resolute face. For some ten minutes or so he remained, speaking
      only when he was spoken to; and then he rose, and nodding a cool
      &ldquo;good-day&rdquo; to the handsome Mr. de Vere and the two traders, he strode to
      the door and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he was half-way from Burrowes&rsquo; house to the mission station, he was
      overtaken by the Rev. Mr. Deighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. de Vere has gone on board again,&rdquo; he said in his slow, solemn way,
      &ldquo;gone on board to get me some English papers. A most estimable and kind
      gentleman, Mr. Blount, an aristocrat to the backbone, but a gentleman, Mr.
      Blount, a gentleman above all. His visit has given me the most unalloyed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be very kind,&rdquo; said Blount, &ldquo;but my judgment has gone very much
      astray if he is what he represents himself to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blount!&rdquo; and the missionary looked genuinely shocked. &ldquo;You are very
      unjust, as well as very much in error. Mr. de Vere is a scion of one of
      the noblest of our many noble English families. He told me so himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, did he! That just confirms me in my opinion of him. Now, look here,
      Mr. Deighton,&rdquo; and his tone became slightly irritated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised
      that this Mr. de Vere&mdash;who, whatever he is, is <i>not</i> a scion of
      any noble English family&mdash;should impose upon men like Burrowes and
      the German, but that he should impose on you does rather surprise me. And
      yet I don&rsquo;t know. It is always the way, or nearly always the way, that
      those whose education and intelligence should be a safeguard to them
      against imposture, are as often imposed upon as the ignorant and
      uncultured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imposture, Mr. Blount! Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that this man De Vere with his flashy get-up and imposing
      name is <i>not</i> an English gentleman. He may deceive you and the men we
      have just left, but he doesn&rsquo;t deceive me. I once lived in England a long
      time ago, Mr. Deighton,&rdquo; here Blount turned his face away, and then added
      dreamily, &ldquo;a long time, a very long time ago, and met some fairly decent
      people. And I no more believe that Mr. de Vere comes from a good family
      than I do that Nathaniel Burrowes, a low, broken-down New Orleans
      wharf-loafer, comes from one of the &lsquo;first families in Virginia&rsquo; that
      American newspapers are always blathering about&rdquo; &ldquo;What is wrong with him,
      Mr. Blount?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing from your point of view&mdash;everything from mine.
      And, so far as I am concerned, I don&rsquo;t mean to have anything to do with
      these two English gentlemen and the yacht <i>Starlight</i>. Well, here we
      are at the mission. Good-day, Mr. Deighton; I&rsquo;m going to Lak-a-lak to see
      how my timber-getters are doing.&rdquo; And with a kindly nod at the troubled
      missionary, the big, dark-faced trader strode along the beach alone.

    <h2>
      III ~ BANDERAH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Banderah, the supreme chief of Mayou, was, <i>vide</i> Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s
      report to his clerical superiors, &ldquo;a man of much intelligence, favourably
      disposed to the spread of the Gospel, but, alas! of a worldly nature, and
      clinging for worldly reasons to the darkness.&rdquo; In other words, Banderah,
      although by no means averse to the poorer natives of the island adopting
      Christianity in a very free and modified form, and contributing a certain
      amount of their possessions to the missionary cause, was yet a heathen,
      and intended to remain one. For Mr. Deighton he had conceived a personal
      liking, mingled with a wondering and contemptuous pity. During an
      intertribal war he had received a bullet in his thigh, which the
      missionary had succeeded, after much difficulty, in extracting.
      Consequently, his gratitude was unlimited, and he evinced it in a very
      practical manner, by commanding some hundreds of his subjects to become
      Christians under pain of death. And, being aware that polygamy would not
      be tolerated by Mr. Deighton, he went a step further, and ordered all
      those of these forced converts who had more than one wife to send them to
      his own harem. This addition to his family duties, was, however, amply
      compensated for by the labour of the surplus wives proving useful to him
      on his yam and taro plantations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his younger days Banderah had once made a voyage to Sydney, in the
      service of a trading captain, one Lannigan, whose name, in those days, was
      a name to conjure with from one end of Melanesia to the other, and for
      whose valour as a fighter and killer of men Banderah had acquired a
      respect he could never entertain for a missionary. This captain, however,
      died in Sydney, full of years and strong drink, and left the chief almost
      broken-hearted, to return a year later to Mayou.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his curious, semi-savage character there were some good points, and one
      was that in compliance with the oft-expressed wishes and earnest
      entreaties of Blount and Mr. Deighton, he had agreed to put down the last
      remnants of cannibalism which had lingered among the coast tribes on the
      island down to the time of this story. And although the older men, and
      some of the priests of the heathen faith, had struggled against his
      drastic legislation, they finally gave in when Mr. Deighton, weeping tears
      of honest joy at such a marvellous and wholesale conversion, presented
      each convert with a new print shirt and a highly coloured picture of the
      Israelites crossing the Red Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after Blount had walked along the beach to Lak-a-lak, Banderah saw
      the captain of the schooner come ashore and walk up the path to Nathaniel
      Burrowes&rsquo; house, where he was warmly greeted by Burrowes and the German.
      He remained there for nearly an hour, and then came out again, and looking
      about him for a few moments, made direct for Banderah&rsquo;s house, which stood
      about three hundred yards back from that of the American trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      When close to the chiefs house the captain of the <i>Starlight</i> raised
      his head, and Banderah caught sight of his features and recognised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Bandy?&rdquo; said the seaman, walking smartly up to the chief,
      who was sitting on a mat inside his doorway, surrounded by a part of his
      harem and family, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t forgotten me, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir. I no forget you,&rdquo; said the native, civilly enough, but
      without warmth. &ldquo;How are you, Cap&rsquo;en Bilker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t call me that, Bandy. I&rsquo;m Captain Sykes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; and Banderah&rsquo;s face at once assumed an expression of the most
      hopeless stupidity. &ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;en Sike. Come inside an&rsquo; sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, my boy,&rdquo; said Bilker genially, fumbling in his coat pocket, and
      producing a large flask of rum, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you a drink, Bandy; and I
      want to have a yarn with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and taking the flask from the captain&rsquo;s hand without deigning
      to look at it, he passed it on to one of his wives. &ldquo;What you want talk me
      about, Cap&rsquo;en? You want me to get you some native for work on plantation?&rdquo;
       and he smiled slily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Bandy. Nothing like that I don&rsquo;t run a labour ship now. I&rsquo;m a big
      fellow gentleman now. I&rsquo;m captain of that yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief nodded, but said nothing. He knew Captain &ldquo;Sykes&rdquo; of old, and
      knew him to be an undoubted rascal. Indeed, about ten years before the
      cunning blackbirder captain had managed to take thirty of Banderah&rsquo;s
      people away in his ship without paying for them; and the moment the chief
      recognised the sailor he set his keen native brain to work to devise a
      plan for getting square with him. And he meant to take deadly vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banderah, old man,&rdquo; and the captain laid one hand on the chiefs naked
      knee, &ldquo;I meant to pay you for those men when I came back next trip. But I
      was taken by a man-of-war,&rdquo; here Bilker crossed his wrists to signify that
      he had been handcuffed; &ldquo;taken to Sydney, put me in calaboose&mdash;ten
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said Banderah quietly, but with a danger spark in his eye,
      &ldquo;man-o&rsquo;-war no make you fas&rsquo; for a long time after you steal my men.
      Plenty people tell me you make two more voyage; then man-o&rsquo;-war catch you
      an&rsquo; make you fas&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe &lsquo;em, Banderah,&rdquo; began the ex-blackbirder, when the
      chief interrupted him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you do with my brother?&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;he die too, in Fiji?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white man&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Banderah. I didn&rsquo;t know your
      brother was aboard when my mate put the hatches on. I thought he had gone
      ashore. I never meant to take him away to Fiji anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; never mind that. But what you want talk to me about?&rdquo; And
      then, as if to put his visitor at his ease, he added, &ldquo;You dam rogue, me
      dam rogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; assented Captain Bilker cheerfully; &ldquo;but look here now, Bandy,
      I&rsquo;m not only going to pay you for those men I took, but give you a lot of
      money as well&mdash;any amount of money; make you a big, rich chief; big
      as Maafu Tonga.{*} But I want you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Maafu of Tonga, the once dreaded rival of King Cacobau of
     Fiji.   He died in 1877.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak me true?&rdquo; inquired the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; answered the captain promptly, extending his hand, which,
      however, Banderah did not appear to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said presently, after a silence of a few moments; then
      making a sign for his women and slaves to withdraw to the further end of
      the room, so that their muttered talk might not disturb the white man and
      himself, he lit his pipe and said, &ldquo;Go on, tell me what you want me to do,
      Cap&rsquo;en.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the ex-blackbirder, laying a finger on the chiefs arm and
      speaking in a low voice, &ldquo;these two white men on board the yacht have got
      any amount of money, gold, sovereigns&mdash;boxes and boxes of it They
      stole it; I know they stole it, although I didn&rsquo;t see them do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Banderah nodded his huge, frizzy head. &ldquo;I savee. These two fellow rogue,
      all same you an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, now, look here, Banderah. I mean to have that gold, and I want you
      to help me to get it. As soon as these men on board are dead I will give
      you a thousand golden sovereigns&mdash;five thousand dollar. Then I&rsquo;ll go
      away in the schooner. Now, listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to do it. The
      Yankee and Peter are going to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Captain Bilker, <i>alias</i> Sykes, unfolded his plan as follows:
      Banderah was to entice De Vere and his friend some miles into the
      interior, where there was a large swamp covered with wild-fowl. Here they
      were to be clubbed by Banderah and his people, and the bodies thrown into
      the swamp. Then Bilker, accompanied by Schwartzkoff and Burrowes, were to
      go on board the schooner and settle the mate and the white steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much sovereign you goin&rsquo; to give Peter and Missa Burrowes?&rdquo; asked
      Banderah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred,&rdquo; answered Bilker; &ldquo;five hundred between them. But I will
      give you a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You no &lsquo;fraid man-o&rsquo;-war catch you by and by?&rdquo; inquired Banderah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Who&rsquo;s going to tell about it? You and your people won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;bout Missa Blount? What &lsquo;bout mission&rsquo;ry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bilker grinned savagely. &ldquo;Peter and Burrowes say they will kill Blount if
      I give them another five hundred sovereigns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;bout mission&rsquo;ry and mission&rsquo;ry woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two Bilker, crime-hardened villain as he was, hesitated.
      Then he raised his head and looked into the dark face of the native chief.
      Its set, savage expression gave him confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty missionaries get killed. And, all the man-o&rsquo;-war captains know
      that the Mayou bush-men{*} are very savage. Some day&mdash;in about a week
      after I have gone away in the schooner, you will take the missionary and
      his wife to the little bush town, that Peter and Burrowes tell me he goes
      to sometimes. They will sleep there that night. You and some of your
      people will go with them and sleep in the same house with them. You do
      that sometimes, Banderah, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Bushmen,&rdquo; a term applied to natives living in the
     interior of the Melanesian Islands.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was perfectly true. The bush tribes on Mayou, although at war with
      Banderah and his coast tribes, yet occasionally met their foes in an
      amicable manner at a bush village called Rogga, which had been for many
      decades a neutral ground. Here Banderah and his people, carrying fish,
      tobacco, and bamboos filled with salt water,{*} would meet small parties
      of bush people, who, in exchange for the commodities brought by Banderah,
      would give him yams, hogs, and wild pigeons. At several of these meetings
      Mr. Deighton had been present, in the vain hope that he might establish
      friendly relations with the savage and cannibal people of the interior.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Having no salt, the bush tribes of Melanesia, who dare not
     visit the coast, buy salt water from the coast tribes. They
     meet a a spot which is always sacredly kept as a neutral
     ground.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the ruffian, &ldquo;you will sleep at Rogga with the missionary
      and his wife. In the morning, when you and your people awake, the
      missionary and his wife will be dead. Then you will hurry to this place;
      you will go on board the man-of-war and tell the captain that the bad
      bushmen killed them when they were asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I savee. Everybody savee Mayou man-a-bush like kill white men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Bandy. No one will say you did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &lsquo;bout Peter an&rsquo; Burrowes? Perhaps by and by those two fellow get mad
      with me some day, and tell man-o&rsquo;-war I bin kill three white man and one
      white woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banderah,&rdquo; and Bilker slapped him on the shoulder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a damned smart
      fellow! There&rsquo;s no mistake about that. Now look here, I want you to get
      another thousand sovereigns&mdash;the thousand I am going to give to
      Burrowes and Peter. And after the man-a-bush have killed the missionary
      and his wife, they are coming down to the beach one night soon after, and
      will kill the two white men. Then there will be no more white men left,
      and you&rsquo;ll be the biggest chief in the world&mdash;as big as Maafu Tonga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious smile stole over the grim features of the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! Cap&rsquo;en, you savee too much; you dam fine man altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here now, Banderah. Are you going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do it right enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-mollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow will do. And, look here, Bandy, I&rsquo;m going to give you ten
      sovereigns each for the men I took away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the chief, &ldquo;now you go away. I want go and look out
      for some good men come along me to-mollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are, Banderah. Take plenty good men. You know what to do&mdash;white
      men walk along swamp to shoot duck, then <i>one, two,</i>&rdquo; and Captain
      Bilker made a motion with his right hand that was perfectly comprehensible
      to the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banderah sat perfectly quiet on his mat and watched the captain return to
      Burrowes&rsquo; house, from where a short time after he emerged, accompanied by
      his two fellow-conspirators. Then the three of them hailed the schooner. A
      boat put off and took them on board.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An hour or two later Blount returned along the beach from Lak-a-lak, and
      walked slowly up the path to his house. Just as he entered the door the
      sounds of revelry came over to him from the schooner, whose lights were
      beginning to glimmer through the quick-falling darkness of the tropic
      night. Some one on board was playing an accordion, and presently he caught
      the words of a song&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, too, the patriots&rsquo; gore That flecked the streets of Baltimore;
      Maryland, my Maryland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burrowes only sings that when he&rsquo;s very drunk,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he
      sat down to drink a cup of coffee brought to him by his eldest daughter
      Taya. &ldquo;No doubt he and that anointed sweep Bilker are having a very happy
      time together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the girl in the native tongue, as he put down his cup,
      &ldquo;Banderah is here. He came but now, and will not come inside, but waits
      for thee in the copra-house, lest he be seen talking to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is wrong?&rdquo; muttered Blount, as without waiting to touch
      the coffee prepared for him he went outside to the copra-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour he and the native chief came out together, and as they
      stood for a minute in the broad streak of light that streamed out from the
      lamp on the table in the big room, Taya, who sat in the doorway, saw her
      father&rsquo;s face was set and stern-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shed thou no blood, Banderah,&rdquo; he said in the native tongue, &ldquo;not even
      that of these two dogs who have eaten and drunk in my house for four
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Challi,{*} that is hard. Already are my people thirsty for the blood of
      this dog of a captain&mdash;he who stole thirty and one of my people. And
      because of my brother, who was stolen with them, have I promised them
      vengeance. But the other two who are with him on the ship I will spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Charlie.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will. And as for these two dogs who have planned to kill me, with
      them I shall deal myself. If, when the schooner saileth away from here,
      these men go not with her, then shall I shoot them dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; and then grasping the white man&rsquo;s hand, the chief pressed his nose
      to his, and vanished in the darkness.

    <h2>
      IV ~ &ldquo;DEATH TO THEM BOTH!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning Messrs. de Vere and Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;the
      latter being now quite recovered&mdash;informed Mr. and Mrs. Deighton
      that, having heard from the two traders there was good shooting at the big
      swamp, they were going there under the guidance of Banderah and a party of
      natives; and shortly after breakfast the chief, accompanied by a number of
      his people, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send with you two of my best men,&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton, indicating a
      couple of his pet converts, who stood by dressed for the occasion in white
      starched shirts and black coats, but minus trousers, of which garments the
      pet converts had divested themselves, knowing that they should have to
      wade through the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, to the missionary&rsquo;s astonishment, Banderah, with a savage
      look, bade them stay where they were. He had, he said, plenty of men, and
      did not need Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the two yachting gentlemen, arrayed in a very stylish sporting
      get-up, appeared with their breach-loaders and cartridge-belts, and waving
      their hands gracefully to the missionary and his wife, disappeared with
      Banderah and his dark-skinned companions into the dense tropical jungle,
      the edge of which was within a very short distance of the mission station.
    </p>
    <p>
      For about an hour the Honourable Morcombe-Lycett and Mr. de Vere, with
      Banderah leading the way, walked steadily onward through the jungle. Not a
      word was spoken among the natives who followed close at their heels, and
      Banderah himself, in answer to their frequent questions, replied only by
      monosyllables..
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came out of the stifling heat of the thick jungle, and saw
      before them a great reedy swamp, the margin fringed by a scanty growth of
      cocoanut and pandanus palms. Out upon the open patches of water, here and
      there showing upon the broad expanse of the swamp, they saw large flocks
      of wild duck feeding and swimming about, betraying not the slightest fear
      at their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Baxter,&rdquo; said Mr. de Vere to his friend, &ldquo;looks good enough,
      doesn&rsquo;t it? I wonder if these blasted niggers will go in for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they will. But let us have a drink first. Here, you, bring us
      that basket. I wonder what sort of tucker old Godliness has given us. He&rsquo;s
      not a bad sort of an ass. His wife, too, isn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; and Mr. de Vere twirled his long, yellow moustache, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re always
      finding out something nice in the face of every woman you come across.
      Wait until we get up to Japan; then you can amuse yourself with a new type
      of woman. Be a bit of a change for you after the Melbourne and Sydney
      peroxided-hair beauties. Here, nigger, give me that corkscrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Dalton,&rdquo; suddenly remarked his friend, &ldquo;&lsquo;pon my soul I believe we
      are making a mistake in going to Japan. You may be sure that we&rsquo;ll have a
      lot of trouble awaiting us there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it Before we get there every one will have read the cable
      news that we have been seen in Callao, and no one in Yokohama will ever
      think of associating Mr. Herbert de Vere and the Honourable
      Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;just arrived from Manila <i>via</i> Singapore in the
      Spanish mail-steamer&mdash;with&mdash;er&mdash;hum&mdash;the two gentlemen
      who arrived at Callao from Tahiti, after successfully diddling the
      Australian financial public of thirty thousand quid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we going to do with the schooner at Manila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell her, my innocent! Sell her to our esteemed friend, Mr. Moses
      Steinberg, who has assisted me in previous financial transactions&mdash;before
      I had the pleasure of meeting my present valued colleague, the Honourable
      Mr. Morcombe-Lycett&mdash;and who is now taking care to inform the world
      that we are living in South America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are we going to account for our boxes of sovereigns? Two mining
      speculators don&rsquo;t usually carry about heavy sums in gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All managed, my boy. My friend, Mr. Moses Steinberg, will see to that.
      The ten thousand sovereigns will be valuable gold specimens from
      Queensland, and will be placed on board the North German Lloyd&rsquo;s steamer
      at Singapore for safe conveyance to London, where you and I, my dear boy,
      will follow it And there also we shall find, I trust, an additional sum of
      fifteen thousand lying to our credit&mdash;the proceeds of our honest
      toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with Sykes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him £500 and tell him to hold his tongue. He&rsquo;s a thundering rascal,
      and we must pay to shut his mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the two proceeded to discuss their lunch, and as they ate and drank
      and talked and laughed, Banderah and three or four of his men whispered
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize them from behind and bind them tightly,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;but kill
      them not, for that I have promised to Challi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Morcombe-Lycett had just finished his last glass of bottled
      beer and wanted to smoke. He had taken out his cigar-case, and, wondering
      at the sudden silence which had fallen upon their native guides, turned
      round to see where they were, and saw swiftly advancing upon himself and
      his companion some half a dozen stalwart natives. In that momentary glance
      he read danger, and quick as lightning&mdash;for he was no coward&mdash;he
      seized his loaded gun, which lay beside him, and fired both barrels one
      after another, at not ten yards&rsquo; range.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of savage yells answered the shots, as two of the natives fell,
      but ere he could reload or Dalton could fire there came a fierce rush of
      all the dark-skinned men upon them, and, struggling madly for their lives,
      they were borne down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the lust of slaughter overcame their fierce assailants, and
      despite Banderah and two or three of his most trusted men, a club was
      raised and fell swiftly upon the white, fair forehead of &ldquo;Mr. de Vere&rdquo; as
      he sought to tear away his hands from the vice-like grasp of two huge
      natives who held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death to them both!&rdquo; cried a thin-faced, wrinkled old man named Toka; &ldquo;<i>hutu</i>:{*}
      for the lives of the thirty and one.&rdquo; Then springing out from the rest, he
      swung a short-handled, keen-bladed hatchet over his head, and sank it into
      the brain of the wretched Baxter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Synonymous with Maori <i>utu</i>&mdash;revenge.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand thou aside, Banderah, son of Paylap,&rdquo; screamed the old man, waving
      the bloody hatchet fiercely at him. &ldquo;I, old Toka, the priest, will to-day
      again show the men of Mayou how to drink the blood and eat the flesh of
      the long pigs the gods have given into our hands,&rdquo; and again he buried the
      weapon in Baxter&rsquo;s breathless body. And as Banderah looked at the old
      man&rsquo;s working face, and saw the savage mouth, flecked with foam, writhing
      and twisting in horrible contortions, and then saw the almost equally
      dreadful visages of the rest of his men, he knew that the old, old lust
      for human flesh had come upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with the one idea of saving Blount and the missionary and his wife, he
      turned and fled through the forest towards the beach.

    <h2>
      V ~ THE TAPU OF BANDERAH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Rev. Wilfrid and Mrs. Deighton were at lunch, talking about the genial
      manners and other qualifications of their guests, when suddenly they heard
      a rapid step on the verandah, and Blount dashed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was white with excitement, and they saw that he carried his
      revolver in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name is wrong, Mr. Blount? Why are you armed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t ask me now! Our lives are in danger&mdash;deadly,
      imminent danger. Follow me to my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; began Mr. Deighton, &ldquo;I do not see&mdash;I fail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, don&rsquo;t talk! Do you think I do not know what I am saying? Your two
      friends are both murdered. Banderah is now at my house, too exhausted to
      tell me more than to come and save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear me! Oh, this is dreadful! Let us, Alice, my dear, seek Divine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; and the trader seized the missionary by the arm as he was
      about to sink upon his knees. &ldquo;Stay here and pray if you like&mdash;and
      get your throat cut In ten&mdash;in five minutes more, every native except
      Banderah will be here ready to burn and murder. I tell you, man, that our
      only chance of safety is to reach my house first, and then the schooner.
      Come, Mrs. Deighton. For God&rsquo;s sake, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pushing past the missionary, he seized Mrs. Deighton by the hand and
      descended the steps. They had scarcely gone two hundred yards when they
      heard a strange, awful cry peal through the woods; and Mr. Deighton
      shuddered. Only once before had he heard such a cry, and that was when,
      during the early days of the mission, he had seen a native priest tear out
      the heart of a victim destined for a cannibal feast, and hold it up to the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly little Mrs. Deighton gasped and tottered as they hurried her
      along; she was already exhausted. Then Deighton stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blount... go on by yourself. We have not your strength to run at this
      speed. I will help my wife along in a minute or two. Some of the mission
      people will surely come to our aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they?&rdquo; said Blount grimly. &ldquo;Look for yourself and see; there&rsquo;s not a
      soul in the whole village. They have gone to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
      made an expressive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Deighton groaned. &ldquo;My God, it is terrible!&mdash;&rdquo; then suddenly, as
      he saw his wife&rsquo;s deathly features, his real nature came out &ldquo;Mr. Blount,
      you are a brave man. For God&rsquo;s sake save my dear wife! I am too exhausted
      to run any further. I am too weak from my last attack of the fever. But we
      are only a quarter of a mile away from your house now. Take her on with
      you, but give me your revolver. I can at least cover your retreat for a
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blount hesitated, then giving the weapon to the missionary, he lifted the
      fainting woman in his arms, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try and come on a little; as soon as I am in sight of the house your wife
      will be safe; you must at least keep me in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the trader strode along, carrying the unconscious woman in his strong
      arms, the missionary looked at the weapon in his hand, and shuddered
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God forgive me if I have done wrong,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But take the life
      of one of His creatures to save my own I never will. Yet to save hers I
      must do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with trembling feet but brave heart he walked unsteadily along after
      the trader and his burden. So far, no sound had reached him since that one
      dreadful cry smote upon his ear, and a hope began to rise in his breast
      that no immediate danger threatened. A short distance away, embowered
      among the trees, was the house of Burrowes. The door was closed, and not a
      sign of life was discernible about the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, were they asleep?&rdquo; He had heard that Burrowes and the German had
      been carousing all the morning with the captain of the <i>Starlight</i>.
      Likely enough they were all lying in a drunken slumber. &ldquo;God, give me
      strength to warn them,&rdquo; he said to himself; and then with a last glance at
      Blount and his wife, he resolutely turned aside and began to ascend the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he gained the summit, Blount had reached the fence surrounding
      his house, and Banderah and Taya and her two young brothers, rifles in
      hand, met the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, take her!&rdquo; and he pushed Mrs. Deighton into Taya&rsquo;s arms and looked
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! he&rsquo;s going up to Burrowes&rsquo; house! Come, Banderah,&rdquo; and he started
      back again, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be speared or shot before he gets there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as the missionary reached the door and began in feeble, exhausted
      tones to call out, Blount and the chief caught up to him, and seizing his
      hands dragged him away again down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about them, they are all on board,&rdquo; was all Blount said. And
      there was no time to talk, for now fierce cries were heard in the
      direction of the mission house, and Blount and Banderah, looking back, saw
      black, naked figures leap over the low stone wall enclosing the
      missionary&rsquo;s dwelling and disappear inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; muttered the trader, as dragging Mr. Deighton between them
      they gained the house, and sat the missionary down beside his wife, who
      with a cry of thankfulness threw her arms about his neck and then quietly
      fainted.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      For nearly half an hour Blount, with Banderah and the missionary by his
      side, looked out through the windows and saw the natives plundering and
      wrecking the mission house and the dwellings of Schwartzkoff and Burrowes.
      A mile away, motionless upon the glassy waters of the harbour, lay the
      schooner, with her boat astern, and every now and then Blount would take a
      look at her through his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a soul on deck,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Deighton. &ldquo;I heard that Peter
      and Burrowes went off this morning with the captain, all pretty well
      drunk. Would to God I knew what is best to do! To go on board would
      perhaps mean that those ruffians would shoot us down before we were
      alongside. No, we&rsquo;ll stay here and take our chance. Banderah says he feels
      pretty sure that he can protect us from his own people. They&rsquo;d never dare
      to hurt him; and I think <i>that</i> will steady them a bit,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to the fence, upon which, at intervals, were tied green cocoanut
      boughs. These had just been placed there by Banderah himself, and meant
      that the house was <i>tapu</i>&mdash;it and all in it were sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it may!&rdquo; said Mr. Deighton, and looking at the mystic sign, the
      use of which he had so often tried to put down as a silly, heathenish
      practice, he felt a twinge of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the work of plunder was over, and then Blount saw a swarm of
      black, excited savages, led by two or three &ldquo;devil-doctors&rdquo; or priests,
      advance towards the house. At the same moment Banderah, looking seaward,
      saw that the boat had left the schooner and was pulling ashore. He was
      just about to point her out to the trader when, for some reason, he
      changed his mind, turned away, and joined his white friends at the other
      end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the lead of the &ldquo;devil-doctors,&rdquo; who, stripped to the waist, and
      with their heads covered with the hideous masks used in their
      incantations, looked like demons newly arisen from the pit, the yelling
      swarm of natives at last reached the fence outside Blount&rsquo;s house; and Mr.
      Deighton, with an inward groan, saw among them some of his pet converts,
      stark naked and armed with spears and clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaping and dancing with mad gyrations, and uttering curious grunting
      sounds as their feet struck the ground, the devil-doctors at last came
      within a few feet of the gate in the trader&rsquo;s fence. Then, suddenly, as
      they caught sight of a branch of cocoanut leaf twisted in and around the
      woodwork of the gate, they stopped their maddened whirl as if by magic;
      and upon those behind them fell the silence of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; muttered Blount, &ldquo;we are safe. They will not break Banderah&rsquo;s
      <i>tapu</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, rifle in hand, and with quiet, unmoved face, Banderah opened the
      trader&rsquo;s door and came out before them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who among ye desires the life of Banderah and those to whom he has given
      his <i>tapu?</i>&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smaller of the two priests dashed aside his mask, and revealed the
      face of the old man Toka, who had struck Baxter his death-blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who indeed, O chief? If it be to thy mind to make <i>tapu</i> this house
      and all in it, who is there dare break it? To the white man Challi and his
      sons and daughters we meant no harm, though sweet to our bellies will be
      the flesh of those whom we have slain and who now roast for the feast. But
      more are yet to come; for I, Toka, lost my son, when thou, Banderah, lost
      thy brother; and the gods have told me that I shall eat my fill of those
      who stole him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The savage, bitter hatred that rang through the old man&rsquo;s voice, and the
      deep, approving murmur of those who stood about him, warned both Banderah
      and Blount that the lust for slaughter was not yet appeased; so it was
      with a feeling of intense surprise and relief that he and the missionary
      saw them suddenly withdraw, and move rapidly away to the rear of the house
      among the thick jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s d&mdash;&mdash;d curious!&rdquo; said Blount, turning to Banderah and
      speaking in English; and then the chief took him by the arm and pointed
      towards the shore&mdash;the boat, pulled by Schwartzkoff and Bur-rowes,
      with Captain Bilker sitting in the stern, had just touched the beach. Then
      it flashed across his mind in an instant why the natives had left so
      suddenly&mdash;they were lying in ambush for the three men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! bad as they are, I can&rsquo;t let them walk to their deaths,&rdquo; said
      Blount, jumping outside, so as to hail and warn them. But before he could
      utter a sound, Banderah sprang upon him and clapped his hand to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Challi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they must die. Try to save them, and we all perish.
      For the sake of thy daughters and of thy sons, raise not thy voice nor thy
      hand. Must all our blood run because of these three dogs&rsquo; lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke the end came. Staggering up the beach in drunken
      hilarity, the three whites did not notice, as they headed for the path, a
      file of natives, armed with spears and clubs, walk quietly along between
      them and the water&rsquo;s edge. There they sat down and waited. But not for
      long, for presently from out the thick, tangled jungle in front came a
      humming whirr of deadly arrows and in a few seconds the three white men
      were wallowing in their blood. Then came that bloodcurdling shout of
      savage triumph, telling those who heard it that all was over. Before its
      echoes died away the bleeding bodies were carried to where a thick, heavy
      smoke rising from the jungle told the shuddering missionary that the awful
      feast was preparing. When he looked again not a native was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing apart in the room from the others, Blount and Banderah spoke
      hurriedly together, and then the trader came to the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Deighton, if you wish to save your wife&rsquo;s and your own life, and
      escape from this slaughterhouse, now is your time. As God is my judge I
      believe we shall never be safe again, and I would gladly go with you if I
      could. But my daughter Nelly is at Lak-a-lak, and&mdash;well, that settles
      it. Banderah here will tell you that he dreads your staying, as the
      priests may plot your death at any moment. I implore you, sir, to think of
      your wife. See, there is the boat, drifting along the beach with the tide.
      For God&rsquo;s sake be advised and get on board the schooner, and whatever port
      you do reach, send a vessel to take me away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, before the missionary and his wife could realise what was happening,
      Banderah had run to the beach, swam to the boat, seized the painter,
      gained the shore again, and pulled her along till opposite the trader&rsquo;s
      house, just as Blount and Taya, supporting Mrs. Deighton between them,
      were leaving the house to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty minutes more they were close to the <i>Starlight</i>, and saw
      that her crew were weighing the anchor. On the after deck stood the mate
      and steward with rifles in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of God is wrong?&rdquo; said the mate, as the boat ranged up
      alongside, and the missionary and his wife were assisted on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask now, man. Get your anchor up as quick as you can and put to
      sea. Your captain and the two passengers are all dead. Clear out at once
      if you don&rsquo;t want the ship to be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought something was wrong when I saw the native dragging the boat
      along. Lend us a hand to get under weigh, will you?&rdquo; and the mate sprang
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another five minutes the <i>Starlight&rsquo;s</i> anchor was up, and then
      Blount and Banderah, with a hurried farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Deighton,
      sprang into the boat and pushed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God bless and keep you,&rdquo; called out the missionary to Blount, &ldquo;and
      may we meet again soon;&rdquo; then sinking on his knees beside his wife, he
      raised his face to heaven, and the trader saw that tears were streaming
      down his worn and rugged cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blount never heard of the missionary and his wife again. Long, long
      afterwards he did hear that some wreckage of a vessel like the <i>Starlight</i>
      had been found on Rennel Island, and that sovereigns were discovered among
      the pools and crevices of the reef for many years after. Whether she ran
      ashore or drifted there dismasted&mdash;for a heavy gale set in a week
      after she left Mayou&mdash;is one of those mysteries of the sea that will
      never be solved.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
